LightFM
=======
*Very early development stage, not ready for production work! :)*

A light file manager and browser written in PHP with Nette framework. 
Directories can be protected by password from public access and directory owners can upload, move or delete their files. Does not needs any database.

Licensed under New BSD license and also GNU GPLv2 - use what do you need (see LICENSE.txt file)

Note: 
-----
Highlight library is only under GPLv2 so it shouldn't be included under the BSD 
license, but during the initial heavy development I'm keeping it included, once 
things settle little, I will change it.


Changelog:
---------
v0.1 alpha - 24. Mar. 2013
- Basic functions for browsing are working, but still many missing things
